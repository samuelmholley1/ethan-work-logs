# Editable Timesheet Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented full CRUD operations for time blocks on the summary page, allowing users to add, edit, and delete time entries directly from the weekly timesheet view.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
1. **src/components/EditableTimeBlock.tsx**
   - Inline editing component for individual time blocks
   - Features:
     - Edit mode with time inputs (HH:mm format)
     - Delete with confirmation
     - Validation (end > start, required fields)
     - Loading states during save/delete
     - Error handling and display
   
2. **src/components/EditableTimesheet.tsx**
   - Client-side wrapper for the entire timesheet
   - Features:
     - Displays time blocks with edit/delete actions
     - "Add Time Block" button per session/date
     - Inline form for adding new blocks
     - Optimistic UI updates
     - Auto-refresh after mutations
     - Weekly total calculation
   
3. **src/components/WeekSummaryClient.tsx**
   - Client wrapper that handles data refreshing
   - Integrates EditableTimesheet with behavioral events display
     - PDF export buttons
   - Loading indicator during refresh

### API Endpoints
1. **src/app/api/time-blocks/route.ts**
   - POST: Create new time block
   - Validates: sessionId, startTime, endTime
   - Checks: end > start
   
2. **src/app/api/time-blocks/[id]/route.ts**
   - PUT: Update existing time block
   - DELETE: Remove time block
   - Same validation as POST

### Modified Files
1. **src/app/summary/page.tsx**
   - Refactored to separate server/client components
   - Server component fetches data
   - Serializes data for client (Date objects → ISO strings)
   - Passes to WeekSummaryClient

## Features Implemented

### Inline Editing
- Click "Edit" button on any time block
- Modify start/end times using native time inputs
- Real-time validation
- Save/Cancel actions
- Error messages displayed inline

### Add Time Block
- "+ Add Time Block to [Date]" button at end of each day
- Inline form with time inputs
- Validates against session date
- Automatically links to correct work session
- Cancellable before submission

### Delete Time Block
- "Delete" button on each time block
- Browser confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?")
- Removes from Airtable
- Page auto-refreshes to show updated totals

### Data Flow
1. Server Component (WeekSummary) fetches data from Airtable
2. Serializes and passes to WeekSummaryClient
3. EditableTimesheet manages local state
4. User actions call API endpoints
5. On success, router.refresh() refetches server data
6. UI updates with fresh data from Airtable

### Validation
- Start time must be before end time
- Both times required
- Times combined with session date
- Proper ISO string formatting for Airtable
- Error messages: "End time must be after start time", etc.

### UX Features
- Loading states ("Saving...", "Deleting...", "Adding...")
- Disabled buttons during operations
- "Refreshing..." toast notification
- Form resets after successful add
- Error recovery (can retry after failure)
- Maintains table structure (rowspan calculations)

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Client components use useState for local state
- useTransition for server refresh coordination
- router.refresh() triggers server re-render
- Optimistic UI with loading indicators

### API Integration
- Direct Airtable REST API calls (PATCH, POST, DELETE)
- Proper error handling with status codes
- Validation on both client and server
- WorkSessions link field properly maintained

### Time Handling
- date-fns for parsing and formatting
- Native HTML5 time inputs (HH:mm)
- Combines time with session date
- Preserves timezone context
- ISO 8601 strings for Airtable

## Remaining Considerations

### Future Enhancements
1. Edit/delete behavioral events (similar UI)
2. Bulk operations (delete multiple blocks)
3. Undo functionality
4. Offline support with IndexedDB queue
5. Real-time collaboration indicators
6. Audit trail for changes

### Known Limitations
1. No undo (must manually recreate deleted blocks)
2. Page refresh required (no WebSocket updates)
3. No conflict resolution (last write wins)
4. Manual entry sessionId not editable

## Testing Checklist
✅ Component compilation (no TypeScript errors)
✅ Build succeeds (Next.js production build)
✅ API endpoints created with proper validation
✅ Edit time block UI renders
✅ Delete time block UI renders
✅ Add time block UI renders
✅ Time validation logic implemented
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ Loading states implemented
✅ Refresh mechanism implemented

## Deployment Status
Ready for testing on development environment.
All files compile successfully.
No runtime errors expected.
