6. Report any failures immediately

---

## Core Workflows

### 1. Clock In Workflow ‚è±Ô∏è

**Expected Behavior**: Timer starts counting, service selector appears, data syncs to Airtable

- [ ] **Open app** - Shows "Not Clocked In" with 00:00:00
- [ ] **Click "Clock In" button** - Button becomes disabled momentarily
- [ ] **Verify timer starts** - Should show 00:00:01, 00:00:02, 00:00:03...
- [ ] **Check console** - Should see "Clocked in: {object}" with sessionId
- [ ] **Service selector appears** - CLS and Supported Employment buttons show
- [ ] **Select a service** - Can select either CLS or Supported Employment
- [ ] **Check Airtable sync** - Console should show successful sync (no 404 errors)
- [ ] **Verify can't clock in twice** - Clock In button should be hidden/disabled

**üî¥ CRITICAL**: If timer stays at 00:00:00, this is the bug we fixed. Report immediately.  
**üî¥ CRITICAL**: If console shows 404 errors with "placeholder_base", env variables not working.

---

### 2. Behavioral Logging Workflow üìä

**Expected Behavior**: Can log behavioral events while clocked in, data syncs to Airtable

- [ ] **Switch to Behavioral Logger tab** - Click "üìä Behavioral Logger" button
- [ ] **Outcomes load** - Should see list of behavioral outcomes (e.g., "Follow Instructions", etc.)
- [ ] **Select an outcome** - Click on one of the outcomes
- [ ] **VP/PP/I/U buttons appear** - Four logging buttons show
- [ ] **Click VP button** - Should see success toast "Logged: [Outcome] - VP"
- [ ] **Check count updated** - VP count should show 1/VP
- [ ] **Try PP button** - Should see "Logged: [Outcome] - PP"
- [ ] **Try I button** - Should see "Logged: [Outcome] - I"
- [ ] **Try U button** - Should see "Logged: [Outcome] - U"
- [ ] **Check recent events** - Should see list of recent events with timestamps
- [ ] **Test comment** - Click comment icon, add note, verify saves
- [ ] **Check Airtable sync** - Console should show behavioral event syncs

**üü° MEDIUM**: If outcomes don't load, check Airtable connection.  
**üü¢ NICE**: If comments work, this is bonus functionality.

---

### 3. Break Workflow ‚òï

**Expected Behavior**: Break pauses timer, end break resumes, no data loss

- [ ] **While clocked in, click "Start Break"** - Button should appear when clocked in
- [ ] **Verify timer pauses** - Timer should stop incrementing
- [ ] **Check status** - Should show "On Break" indicator
- [ ] **Wait 5 seconds** - Timer should remain frozen
- [ ] **Click "End Break"** - Resume button appears
- [ ] **Verify timer resumes** - Should continue from where it paused
- [ ] **Check no data loss** - Previous behavioral events still visible
- [ ] **Check Airtable** - Break should be recorded

**üü¢ LOW**: Break functionality is supplementary, not critical path.

---

### 4. Clock Out Workflow üèÅ

**Expected Behavior**: Shows confirmation, saves all data, clears state, syncs to Airtable

- [ ] **Click "Clock Out" button** - Should be available after clocking in
- [ ] **Confirmation appears** - Shows total time worked
- [ ] **Verify time accurate** - Should match timer display (rounded to 15 min)
- [ ] **Click confirm** - Completes clock out
- [ ] **Check success toast** - "Session ended successfully" message
- [ ] **Verify state cleared** - Timer resets to 00:00:00
- [ ] **Check "Not Clocked In" status** - Back to initial state
- [ ] **Check Airtable sync** - Console shows session saved
- [ ] **Check local storage cleared** - DevTools > Application > Local Storage should be clean

**üî¥ CRITICAL**: If session doesn't save to Airtable, this is a blocker.

---

### 5. Summary/Export Workflow üìÑ

**Expected Behavior**: Summary page shows data, week navigation works, PDFs generate

- [ ] **Click "üìä Summary" button** - Navigate to summary page
- [ ] **Check timesheet section** - Should show work sessions
- [ ] **Check behavioral tally** - Should show VP/PP/I/U counts by outcome
- [ ] **Week navigation** - "Previous Week" and "Next Week" buttons work
- [ ] **Select different week** - Data updates for selected week
- [ ] **Click "Download Timesheet PDF"** - PDF generation starts
- [ ] **Verify PDF downloads** - File downloads with proper name
- [ ] **Open PDF** - Timesheet matches physical template (IMG_2608.jpg)
- [ ] **Check PDF data accuracy** - Times, dates, durations correct
- [ ] **15-minute rounding** - Times rounded properly (5:20 ‚Üí 5:15, 5:23 ‚Üí 5:30)
- [ ] **Click "Download Behavioral PDF"** - Behavioral sheet generates
- [ ] **Open behavioral PDF** - Matches physical template (IMG_2609.jpg)
- [ ] **Check behavioral data** - VP/PP/I/U counts accurate

**üî¥ CRITICAL**: PDF generation is the #1 feature requirement. Must work flawlessly.  
**üî¥ CRITICAL**: PDFs must match physical templates exactly.

---

### 6. Manual Entry Workflow ‚úçÔ∏è

**Expected Behavior**: Can create past entries, validation works, syncs to Airtable

- [ ] **Click "+ Manual Entry" button** - Navigate to manual entry page
- [ ] **Select a date** - Pick a past date (within 1 year)
- [ ] **Add time block** - Fill in start time, end time, outcome
- [ ] **Try invalid time** - End time before start time (should error)
- [ ] **Try future date** - Should be blocked
- [ ] **Try date > 1 year ago** - Should be blocked
- [ ] **Add valid entry** - Proper date and times
- [ ] **Submit** - Should see success message
- [ ] **Check Airtable** - Manual entry synced
- [ ] **Return to summary** - Manual entry appears in timesheet

**üü° MEDIUM**: Manual entry is important for retroactive logging.

---

### 7. Offline Workflow üîå

**Expected Behavior**: Works offline, queues data, syncs when online

- [ ] **While clocked in, go offline** - Turn off WiFi or use DevTools offline mode
- [ ] **Check offline indicator** - Should show "Offline" status
- [ ] **Log behavioral event** - Should still work locally
- [ ] **Check toast** - "Saved locally - will sync when online"
- [ ] **Try to generate PDF** - Should show warning "PDFs require internet"
- [ ] **Go back online** - Turn WiFi back on
- [ ] **Check auto-sync** - Should see "Syncing..." then "Synced"
- [ ] **Verify no data loss** - All offline events now in Airtable
- [ ] **PDF generation works** - Can now generate PDFs

**üü¢ NICE**: Offline functionality is excellent but not critical for first use.

---

### 8. Error/Edge Case Handling üõ°Ô∏è

**Expected Behavior**: Graceful error handling, helpful messages

- [ ] **Invalid input** - Enter letters in time field (should prevent or error)
- [ ] **Very long name** - Enter 500 character outcome name (should truncate)
- [ ] **XSS attempt** - Try `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in comment (should escape)
- [ ] **Rapid clicks** - Click behavioral logging buttons 10x fast (should handle)
- [ ] **Empty session** - Clock in then immediately clock out (should handle)
- [ ] **Browser refresh** - Refresh page while clocked in (should restore state)
- [ ] **Multiple tabs** - Open app in 2 tabs, clock in both (should sync state)

**üü° MEDIUM**: Edge cases are important for production robustness.

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test on multiple browsers (if available):

- [ ] **Chrome** (Desktop)
- [ ] **Safari** (Desktop)
- [ ] **Firefox** (Desktop)
- [ ] **Edge** (Desktop)
- [ ] **Safari** (iOS - iPhone/iPad)
- [ ] **Chrome** (Android)

**üü° MEDIUM**: Primary browser is most important, others nice to have.

---

## Performance Testing

- [ ] **Initial load time** - App loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] **Timer performance** - No lag or stuttering
- [ ] **Behavioral logging speed** - Events log instantly
- [ ] **PDF generation time** - < 10 seconds for normal week
- [ ] **Large dataset** - Test with 100+ behavioral events (speed acceptable?)

**üü¢ LOW**: Performance is good, but not critical for MVP.

---
