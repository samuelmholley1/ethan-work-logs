## 🆕 New Features You'll See

### 1. Success Notifications
Every action now shows a **green success toast** that auto-dismisses:
- Clock in/out: "Success! Data saved."
- Log behavioral event: "Event logged!"
- Smooth slide-in animation from the right
- 2-3 second display, then auto-disappears

### 2. Recent Events History
The Behavioral Logger now has a **"Recent Events (Last 5)"** panel:
- Shows your last 5 logged events
- Color-coded by type (Green=I, Red=U, Blue=VP/PP)
- Displays outcome name, prompt count, and timestamp
- Updates in real-time as you log events

### 3. Last Sync Display
The Timer shows **"Last synced: [time]"** in the status bar:
- Know exactly when your data was saved to Airtable
- Updates every 5 seconds
- Only shows when not actively syncing

### 4. Better Confirmations
Clock out now shows **elapsed time** before confirming:
- "Clock out and end this work session?"
- "Time worked: 2h 15m"
- "This action cannot be undone"

### 5. Input Validation
All inputs are now validated:
- Empty service type = error
- Empty user ID = error
- Invalid service type = error
- Double clock-in = error message
- Forgotten clock-outs detected (> 16 hours)

## 🛡️ What You're Protected Against

| Risk | Protection |
|------|-----------|
| Accidental clock-outs | Better confirmation with time display |
| Double clock-in | Validation blocks it with error |
| Forgotten clock-outs | Detection for sessions > 16 hours |
| Invalid data entry | Input validation checks everything |
| Lost work tracking | Event history shows recent activity |
| Sync uncertainty | "Last synced" timestamp visible |
| No action feedback | Success toasts on all actions |
| Poor mobile UX | Responsive design + haptic feedback |
