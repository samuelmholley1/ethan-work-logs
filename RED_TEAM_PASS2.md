---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Race Conditions from Rapid Clicks
**Problem:** User could click Clock In/Out or Break buttons multiple times before API response, causing:
- Multiple concurrent API calls
- State corruption
- Duplicate data in database
- Confusing UI state

**Fix:**
- Added `isLoading` state variable
- All handlers check `if (isLoading) return` at start
- Set `isLoading = true` during API calls
- Set `isLoading = false` in finally block

**Files Changed:** `Timer.tsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents all race conditions

---

### Issue #2: No Visual Loading Feedback
**Problem:** Buttons looked clickable during API calls, no indication request was processing

**Fix:**
- All buttons now show "Processing...", "Starting...", etc. during operations
- Disabled state with gray background (`bg-gray-300`)
- Cursor changes to `cursor-not-allowed`
- Dynamic className based on `isLoading` state

**Example:**
```tsx
className={`... ${
  isLoading
    ? 'bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed'
    : 'bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white'
}`}
```

**Files Changed:** `Timer.tsx` (all buttons)

**Impact:** ✅ Clear visual feedback prevents user confusion

---

### Issue #3: Poor Error Messages
**Problem:** Generic "Failed to..." alerts didn't show actual error  
**Example:** `alert('Failed to clock in. Please try again.')`

**Fix:**
- Changed to: `alert(error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed...')`
- Shows actual validation errors from timer-store
- Users see "Already clocked in. Please clock out first." instead of generic message

**Files Changed:** `Timer.tsx` (all error handlers)

**Impact:** ✅ Better user guidance, easier debugging

---

### Issue #4: Unlimited VP/PP Prompt Counts
**Problem:** Users could increment VP/PP counters infinitely
- No validation or upper limit
- Unrealistic clinical scenarios (999+ prompts)
- Could cause UI overflow issues

**Fix:**
- Added max count of 99 prompts per type
- Alert user: "Maximum prompt count reached (99). Please log the event."
- Prevents increment if count >= 99
- Reasonable clinical limit

**Files Changed:** `BehavioralLogger.tsx` (handleVP, handlePP)

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents data entry errors, maintains clinical validity

---

### Issue #5: Event History Pushing Buttons Off Screen
**Problem:** Event history panel could grow very tall with long outcome names, pushing action buttons below viewport on mobile

**Fix:**
- Added `max-h-80` (320px max height)
- Added `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling
- Panel scrolls instead of growing infinitely
- Buttons always visible

**Files Changed:** `BehavioralLogger.tsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Better mobile experience, critical buttons always accessible

---

### Issue #6: No Accessibility Support
**Problem:** Screen reader users had no context for buttons
- VP/PP buttons just said "VP" with no explanation
- No indication of current prompt count
- Badge numbers not hidden from screen readers

**Fix:**
- Added ARIA labels to all buttons:
  - `aria-label="Add verbal prompt. Current count: 3"`
  - `aria-label="Log as Independent"`
  - `aria-label="Log as Unsuccessful"`
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative count badges
- Added `aria-label="Recent events history"` to history panel

**Files Changed:** `BehavioralLogger.tsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Fully accessible to screen reader users

---

### Issue #7: No Touch Feedback
**Problem:** Buttons on mobile felt unresponsive, no visual press feedback

**Fix:**
- Added `active:scale-95` to all buttons
- Button scales down slightly when pressed
- Provides immediate tactile feedback
- Standard mobile UX pattern

**Files Changed:** `BehavioralLogger.tsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Better mobile user experience

---

### Issue #8: Service Modal Not Disabled During Loading
**Problem:** User could click multiple service types while first request was processing

**Fix:**
- Service modal buttons now respect `isLoading` state
- Show "Starting..." during clock-in
- Disabled state on all modal buttons
- Cancel button also disabled during loading

**Files Changed:** `Timer.tsx` (service modal section)

**Impact:** ✅ Prevents multiple service selections

---
