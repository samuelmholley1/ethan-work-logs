## Notes for CEO

All Week 1 components have been **fully extracted, adapted, and integrated** with production-ready quality:

1. **Modal**: Professional confirmation dialogs replacing browser popups
2. **ExportProgress**: Step-by-step PDF generation feedback replacing basic loading spinners
3. **Toast**: Enhanced notification system with action buttons and persistent errors

These components establish a **design system foundation** for future work and significantly improve UX over basic browser dialogs and loading messages.

**Ready for production testing and Week 2 work.**
